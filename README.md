### Compiler Design Project Using LEX YACC & C
This is a compiler design project which is done for academic purpose. This may not be directly applicable for professional use cases. There are several bugs/improvements to be fixed and done. The project contains a complete compiler lifecycle such as Lexical analysis, Syntax analysis using Recursive decent parser, Semantic Analysis and Code generation for x86 ISA Architecture. Some of the special features are Symbol table implementation, Recursive Decent parser, AST node generation.

------------

**Compile - For Windows**
`.\build.bat`

**Compile - For Linux/Max**
`./build.sh`

**Clean Files - For Windows**
`.\clean.bat`

**Clean Files - For Linux/Mac**
`./clean.sh`

**Run - For Windows**
`.\main.exe`

**Run - For Mac**
`./a.out`

**Instructions While Running The Compiler**
- While running the compiler, it will ask the name of the input file to run.
- The input file should be a txt file. 
- The name of the file should be provided without the .txt extension when the compiler asks.
- There are several sample input files included.
- input.txt contains a complete test case of the compiler.
- test1.txt .... test7.txt contains test cases for individual statements of the compiler.
